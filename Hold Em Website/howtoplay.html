		<h1><span>How To Play</span></h1>
		
		<h2><span>What Is Needed:</span></h2>
		<ol>
			<li>52-Card Deck</li>
			<li>Poker Chips</li>
			<li>2-20 Players</li>
			<li>A dealer button</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2><span>The Step-by-Step</span></h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The two players to the left of the dealer put out blind bets. The player directly to the dealer's left
			puts out the small blind while the second player to the dealer's left puts out the big blind.</li>
			<li>Every player is dealt two cards, face down. These are called pocket cards.</li>
			<li>The action, or the first move, falls on the player to the left of the big blind. The player can either call the
			bet, raise it, or fold. Betting continues around the table, clockwise.</li>
			<li>After the betting is completed, the dealer burns and three cards are dealt face up in the center of the table, which is referred to 
			as the board. The first three cards in Texas Hold'em are called the flop. These cards are &#34;community cards&#34; meaning
			everyone can (and will) use them in combination with their own pocket cards to make the best hand.</li>
			<li>From the flop on, betting begins with the player to the dealer&#39;s left, who can check, bet, fold or call if someone has
			previously raised during this round of betting.</li>
			<li>The dealer burns one card and fourth card is dealt face up onto the board. This is called the turn.</li>
			<li>Another round of betting</li>
			<li>The dealer burns again and the final card is dealt face up. This card is also called the river.</li>
			<li>A final round of betting occurs. The remaining players show their cards and the person who can make the best five card 
			hand by combining their pocket cards with the cards on the board wins. </li>
			<li>Dealing then restarts for those who wish to continue playing and still have chips remaining.</li>
